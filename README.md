<h2>9. Your future: the scary parts</h2>

<p>Just the thought of not succeeding is very scary. If I am not able to launch a valued career in my chosen field in wed development, I'll probably have to dust myself off after a hard fall and find my place in this world to hustle and make a living. Although I have given some thought to digital marketing. I might be young but I know life has its plans for you, you just need to have a plan A and B if it doesnâ€™t work out. </p>
